# Contributor License Agreement ([CLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement))

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion to the work by you to the licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this [License](./LICENSE.md), without any additional terms or conditions.

Note: this is the so called ["inbound=outbound" CLA](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license), that is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community.
