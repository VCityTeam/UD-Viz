The `LayerManager` object serves as an interface to manage all of the layer of the view
used by UD-Viz. 

It also handle all of the tilesManager that are loaded in the scene. It allows to
select objects that comes from from multiple sources.

The `LayerManager` is filled either during the loading of each 3DTiles layer or it can 
automatically get the layer needed from the view.
