# 3DTiles Debug Tool

This tool is used to perform tests with 3DTiles and buildings in UD-Viz.

Capabilities :

- Use a TilesManager to process and store data about tiles and city objects. The manager can be logged into the console to access its details.
- Get information about a specific building by clicking on it. Also change its style.
- Apply color and opacity to city objects in a tile.

This tool also serves as a demonstration for 3DTiles utility classes and functions. You can find their documentation [here](https://github.com/VCityTeam/UD-Viz/blob/master/src/Widgets/Components/3DTiles/Docs/3DTilesInteraction.md).
