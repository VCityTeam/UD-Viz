# UD-Viz : Urban Data Vizualisation

UD-Viz is a JavaScript library based on [iTowns](https://github.com/itowns/itowns), using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [published on the npm package repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ud-viz), allowing to visualize, analyse and interact with urban data.

### Pre-requisite
Developing UD-Viz requires some knowledge about [JS](https://github.com/VCityTeam/UD-SV/blob/master/UD-Doc/Devel/ToolJavaScript.md), node.js, npm and [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Installation
### Prerequisite: install nodejs and npm

* **Ubuntu**

  * Install and update npm

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install npm    ## Will pull NodeJS
    sudo npm install -g n     
    sudo n latest
    ```

  * References: [how can I update Nodejs](https://askubuntu.com/questions/426750/how-can-i-update-my-nodejs-to-the-latest-version), and [install Ubuntu](http://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/install-nodejs-ubuntu-14-04/#ubuntu-package-manager)

* **Windows**
  
  * Install and update npm with Windows Powershell

    ```bash
    iex (new-object net.webclient).downstring(‘https://get.scoop.sh’)
    scoop install nodejs
    ```

### Installing the UD-Viz library

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VCityTeam/UD-Viz.git
cd UD-Viz
npm install
```

You can find install notes [here](https://github.com/MEPP-team/UD-Viz/blob/master/install.md).

## Demos
Standard application demos using UD-Viz are [gathered in UD-Viz-demo](https://github.com/VCityTeam/UD-Viz-demo)
and some online demos are [available here](https://projet.liris.cnrs.fr/vcity/demos/)

## Organizational principles
Definitions:
 - [Component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering)
   - `Components` folder: a set of components
 - Extension: a component depending on a [web service](https://github.com/VCityTeam/UD-Viz/blob/master/src/Widgets/Extensions/Geocoding/services/GeocodingService.js#L2) in order to be functionnal. 
 - Plugin: a plugin (importable atomic sub-library) of the iTowns framework
 - [web widgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget)

Notes:
 * The position of a specific component in the sub-folder hierarchy reflects
   how it is shared/re-used by the plugins. For example if a given component 
   is only used by a single widget, then it gets defined within that widget 
   folder. But when another component usage is shared by two widgets then 
   its definition directory gets promoted at the level of the two widgets
   ```

        |    └── Component_1         # A component shared by the Game and Widgets plugins
